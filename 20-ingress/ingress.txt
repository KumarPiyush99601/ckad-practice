Ingress concept lets you map traffic to different backends based on rules you define via the Kubernetes API.

Ingress can have the following path types:

1. ImplementationSpecific
2. Exact
3. Prefix

Types of Ingress:

1. Ingress backed by a single service
2. Simple Fanout, where a config routes traffic from a single IP address to more than one Service, based on the HTTP URI being requested.
3. Name based Virtual hosting, this supports routing HTTP traffic to multiple host names at the same IP address.
