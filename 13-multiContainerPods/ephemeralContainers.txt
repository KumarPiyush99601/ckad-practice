Ephemeral Containers are created to do specific functions within a pod but many fields are incompatible. 

Ephemeral containers are created using a special ephemeralcontainers handler in the API  than by adding it directly to specification section of the pod, hence it is not possible to add an ephemeral container using kubectl edit.
