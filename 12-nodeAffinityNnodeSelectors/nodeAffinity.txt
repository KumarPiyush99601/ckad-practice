Node Affinity aalows you to constrain which type of nodes you can schedule on based on node labels. There are two types of Node Affinity:

1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: This means that the scheduler cannot schedule the pod unless the condition is met.

2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: This means that the scheduler will schedule the pod even if the condition is not met.

Following are the logical operators which can be used in the affinity rules:

> In

> NotIn

> Exists

> DoesNotExists
