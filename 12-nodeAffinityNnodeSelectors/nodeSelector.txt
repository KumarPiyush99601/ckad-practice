Node Selector is used to ensure that a pod is scheduled on a specific node, this is done by assigning a label to the node and then using this label in the pod yaml file.

Ex: In the below example pod nodeaffinitypod will be assigned to the node which has label set to large, if it doesnot finds that the pod will be inpending state.

apiVersion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: nodeaffinitypod
  labels:
    env: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nodeaffinitypod
    image: busybox
  nodeSelector:
    size: large
