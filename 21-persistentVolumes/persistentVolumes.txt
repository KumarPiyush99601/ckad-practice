A Persistent Volume is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an adminstrator or dynamically provisioned.

A Persistent Volume Claim is a request for a storgae by a user.

A PV has Retain, Recycle or Delete reclaim policy.

Access Modes:

ReadWriteOnce(RWO): This can allow multiple pods to access that volume when the pods are running on the same node.
ReadOnlyMany(ROX): THe volume can be mounted as read-nly by many nodes.
ReadWriteMany(RWX): The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
ReadWriteOncePod(RWOP): The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod.

Claims use the same Access Modes, Volume Modes as a PV in a PVC.
