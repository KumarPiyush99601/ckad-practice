A serviceAccount provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod, and maps to a serviceAccount object.

There is always one serviceAccount available in the namespace if you do not specify the serviceAccount to be used in your pod, K8 uses the default one.

A token is required to access the serviceAccount if the serviceaAccount has not been mounted in the pod as a volume.

kubectl create sa <serviceaccountname>

kubectl create token <serviceaccountname>

In a pod definition file, the serviceAccountName field is added in the spec section of the yaml file.
